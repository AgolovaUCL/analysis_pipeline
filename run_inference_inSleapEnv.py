"""
SAME AS OTHER SCRIPT, BUT THIS ONE YOU CAN DIRECTLY RUN IN THE SLEAP ENVIRONMENT
this is a quick script that allows you to run your Sleap inference on video files in a directory by calling subprocess. 
It will create a new folder in the OUTPUT_FOLDER with the same structure as the ROOT_FOLDER and save the inference results there.
it will save a .slp file but also an .h5 file for further analysis for example with movement (https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/index.html)


-------
Parameters:
video_folder: the folder where your video files are stored
dest_folder: the folder where you want to save the inference results
centroid_model_folder: folder where centroid model is
centered_model_folder: folder where centered model is


call_inference()
params:
fpath: the path to the video file you want to run inference on
dest_folder: the folder where you want to save the inference results
command_inf: the command to run the inference, you need to change the model paths to your own models
and potentially adjust inference parameters.


when you want to run this script you need to have sleap installed in the environment where you run this script. 
then just open a command line terminal activate the environment and type: python run_inference_on_all.py
