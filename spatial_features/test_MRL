    Computes mean resultant vector length for circular data.

    This statistic is sometimes also called vector strength.

    :param alpha: sample of angles in radians
    :param w: number of incidences in case of binned angle data
    :param ci: ci-confidence limits are computed via bootstrapping,
               default None.
    :param d: spacing of bin centers for binned data, if supplied
              correction factor is used to correct for bias in
              estimation of r, in radians (!)
    :param axis: compute along this dimension, default is None
                 (across all dimensions)
    :param axial_correction: axial correction (2,3,4,...), default is 1
    :param bootstrap_iter: number of bootstrap iterations
                          (number of samples if None)
    :return: mean resultant length
