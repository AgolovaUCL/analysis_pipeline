def getAdaptiveMap(pos_binned, spk_binned, alpha=200/30):
        """
        Produces a ratemap that has been adaptively binned according to the
        algorithm described in Skaggs et al., 1996) [1]_.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pos_binned : np.ndarray
            The binned positional data.
        spk_binned : np.ndarray
            The binned spikes
        alpha : int, optional
            A scaling parameter determing the amount of occupancy to aim at
            in each bin. Defaults to 200/30. In the original paper this was set to 200.
            This is 200/30 here as the pos data is binned in seconds (the original data was in pos
            samples so this is a factor of 30 smaller than the original paper's value, given 30Hz sample rate)

        Returns
        -------
        tuple of np.ndarray
            The adaptively binned spike and pos maps.
            Use this to generate Skaggs information measure

        Notes
        -----
        Positions with high rates mean proportionately less error than those
        with low rates, so this tries to even the playing field. This type
        of binning should be used for calculations of spatial info
        as with the skaggs_info method in the fieldcalcs class (see below)
        alpha is a scaling parameter that might need tweaking for different
        data sets.

        The data [are] first binned
        into a 64 X 64 grid of spatial locations, and then the firing rate
        at each point in this grid was calculated by expanding a circle
        around the point until the following criterion was met:

        Nspks > alpha / (Nocc^2 * r^2)

        where Nspks is the number of spikes emitted in a circle of radius
        r (in bins), Nocc is the number of occupancy samples, alpha is the
        scaling parameter
        The firing rate in the given bin is then calculated as:

        sample_rate * (Nspks / Nocc)
